# Beirut AI & Google Developer Group
# Intro to Neural Networks

We owe the major success of artificial intelligence today to one primary outbreak, the Neural Networks. Do you know how Neural Networks learn and why they are so good at it?

In this workshop, we will demystify the black box of Neural Networks and break them into bits and pieces. We will define Deep Learning and understand its basic unit, Neural Networks: what are they, what‚Äôs the intuition behind them, why now, how do they learn, etc. Through building your first Neural Network model, you will get introduced to the most common deep learning framework today, Tensorflow.
